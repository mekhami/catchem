# Catch'em.

For managing your inventory of animal traps world wide, because animals need catchin'.

# Getting started.

All you need is Python and Django to start.

```
pip install django
cd catchem && python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

Assuming all of that went well, you've got a really basic working home page. Not much to show for it right now, but if you head over to /admin and create a few objects, you'll see a few inventory items on your home page.

# Next Steps

1. Tie the other views in so creating, updating, deleting, and viewing inventory items is super easy.
2. Set up a proper database and configuration.
3. Automate some tests to make sure everything goes smoothly.
4. Make use of some charts and graphs because that's what's important.
